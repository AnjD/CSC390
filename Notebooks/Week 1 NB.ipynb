The DPer News(Digital Personalization of the News) project aims to have robots create personalized news for its patrons.  Can this be possible?  Can robots make a personalized account of events happening around the world?"

    "This article made me think about AI thinking rationally and if it is possible for it to think ratiaonally right from the get go.  The DPer News project has a similar concept, as the AI would have to mimic the writing of a human.  This can only be done if the AI is given time to analyze the patterns of human writing and can't be expected to know ins and outs of human writing.  "
