    "Humans have an intuition of what to do with certain objects.  For example when we see a chair we know to either sit on it, move it, tilt it, or lift it up.  Currently AI agents can identify objects, but don't know what to do with that certain object.  They do not have the same intuition as humans do.  \n",
