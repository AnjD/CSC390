    "Facebook wants to revolutionize the way we use digital assistants.  Instead of speaking to our digital assistant we would communicate with it using our mind.  In a demo they showed a woman using her mind to move a cursor around the screen.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Facebook is looking at the esperiment that computer scientist, Christian Herff, is conducting.  He uses a neural implant in his research to decifer human thoughts and have a computer translate them into actions.  This is a very invasive process, but Facebook wants their way to be non-invasive.  They also want the assistant to decifer a 100 words per minute.  The program is still in the very early stages.  "

One sentence in the article that particularly disturbs me is \"A digital assistant that can literally listen to your thoughts, anywhere and at anytime, and privately.\"  I am unsure of how \"private\" this AI can actually be.
